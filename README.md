1. Welcome to the Introductory Spatial Analysis Workshop
2. This workshop is focused on single molecule spatial analysis paltforms. Therefore, most of the workshop materials are applicable to other spatial platforms other than the xenium.
	- some of the platforms that will benefit from this workshop materials include
		* cosmx
		* merscope
		* slide-seq

	- the only consideration participants have to consider is to carfully fine-tune the parameters to suit the technology platform their dataset is derived from.
3. For questions reagarding the tutorials and lectures, please reach out to the intructors
